## A geek-sport competition platform. 

This platform was created to support a (security)conference style competition. Each attendee gets a pre-generated account on the portal. The organizers create a series of "Tokens" that are somehow hidden. Attendees collect these tokens and enter them into the portal. Depending on the configuration of the given token the attendee will collect some number of "tickets". When the event is over the tickets become entries in a raffel. 

Our team had a good time playing, hopefully it could be of use to you.
